Arise, arise, Riders of Stevoden!  
Fun deeds awake: Mett and barbeque!  
Beer shall be drunken, glass be splintered, a schnapps-day, a drunk day, as the sun rises!  
Ride now, ride now!

Frank had some shorter routes prepared, too, but then led the Schwemmlings astray. Except for Steve and Lenny, everyone kept up. And I crafted myself a shield and helmet for the occasion. Which I wore proudly.
