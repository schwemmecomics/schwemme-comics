You're sitting in the pub and suddenly one of your lecturers walks in...

Tommy didn't help me through the pre-clinical part of my studies with cocktails from textbooks, but with other tips and tricks. Three cheers for Tommy!

*Yes, he mixes the books with pure alcohol. If only it were that easy...*
