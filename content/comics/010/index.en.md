The Ginger Ale Club appears! A group inside the Schwemme with Gingerale as their favourite drink. Thhe three pictured are Veggie, Arne and Axel. Veggie is the token vegetarian, Arne always appears cultivated with shirt, vest and tie, and Axel dreams of having pickels to go with his beer. 

Also, Veggie is allergic to nuts. Maybe also to Liqueur with nuts in it?

*Arne with blond hair for the first time. He usually only wears vest and tie behind the bar.*
