Disciplinary tenderness.

Frank gets miffed, when we leave trash lying around in storage, but without us, there would be nothing to clean up.

*The title is a reference to the song "Chun Lis Spinning Bird Kick" by the band Arctic Monkeys (which is a reference to the video game Street fighter), and the fact of Frank wearing Doc Martens boots.
