Glass bottles shall be correctly sorted into their corresponding cases.

What we have here is a crime of war, according to the geneva conventions. Bulmers, a cider, is not sold as a deposit bottle (You know, those glass bottles in germany you get a few cents back if you bring them back to the store?). And Frank is a bit touchy about wrongly sorted deposit cases in storage (because he has to sort them all for pickup). Transgressions against the holy storage order will be punished directly. 

*I thought about painting the background darker in every panel, but the way i drew it now the mysterious shadow in the third panel (oh noe! Who could it be?!) seems much more menacing.*
