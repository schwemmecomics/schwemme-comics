Flo has certain topics, which he rotates through like on a playlist. Astonishingly, he isn't stopped at topics, politically versed non-members would expect, but at his favourite initiation ritual.

Is trauma or a fetish the reason behind this? Who knows, everyone should keep a bit of a mystery to themselves ...

Discussions with Flo are exhausting, while his mood rises. He's like a vampire in that regard.
