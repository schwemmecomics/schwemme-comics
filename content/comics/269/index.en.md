How about saying "I just did a Hokusai" instead of "I just spilled my beer"?

Atilla and I were talking about instruments, when suddenly! His beer spilled itself. Without warning. Without explanation. 

*I obviously exaggerated this for comical purposes. And it took a bit getting "The Big Wave" right. Also, drenched Atilla is a mood.*
