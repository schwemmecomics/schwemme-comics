Obviously, Ernestito is my go-to-character (and he survived his death in the last comic strip). So much for self-portrayal.

This has to be the fourth comic about ventilation? Sometimes it seems more effective to just open the refrigerators, instead of activating the ventilation. When the bar area is full, the air movement does not bring a lot of improvement. 

*I should consider to not always default to me if i need a stand-in. Instead i should look for people who didn't appear for some time. Or maybe guest appearances?*
