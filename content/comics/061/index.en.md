It doesn't need much, but at least a bit oxygen.

Since Schwemme is in a cellar, it gets a bit stuffy on lively evenings. Especially if the ventilation shuts down on its own. When people have trouble breathing, the bartenders get humorously reminded to turn the ventilation back on.

*Not much decoration in the scene, but the joke does not require any.
