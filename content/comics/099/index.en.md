Typical Bob. Bob is a welcomed regular, who rivals Lenny regarding suggestive jokes.

Lenny and Diddi are part of a poker group who regularily play at Schwemme. Lenny holds the record for the longest winning streak (for now).

*Not really pleased with how Bob turned out in the last two panels. Somehow his hair and beard didn't want to be drawn.*
