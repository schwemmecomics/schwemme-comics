Yay, new characters!

Standing behind the bar is Pipilotta (Ernestitos little sister), the one in front of the bar is Kilian from the TV Club.

As told in comic 06, Schwemmlings get their real names, when they become a member. Since Pipilotta has not yet been officially initiated, she doesn't have a name.
