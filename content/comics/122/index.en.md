The wet wipe comes running when called.

While disconnecting the keg from the beer drafting system, sometimes there is a bit of residual beer left in the connection. And while there is a paper towel dispenser now mounted near the kegs (the so called barrel roll), there are always opportunities for banter regarding wet wipes behind the bar.

*In the comics it seems like the door behind the bar directly connects towards the storage. Actually, there is a corridor in between. Would it be worth it to correct this?*
