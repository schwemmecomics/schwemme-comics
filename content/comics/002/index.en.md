First appearance of Flozi and Steve. Steve works a lot behind the scenes to keep the club running smoothly. Flozi was a member who is now a regular. His life's work is to be a nuisance and to push his provocating opinions onto others. 

Noone is really a member of Schwemme, before they had to discuss with Flo, at 3 in the morning, why he won't get a whisky hours after last round.

*The comics being slanted is a stylistic element by the way, definitely not because i would have to redraw the whole strip to correct it*
