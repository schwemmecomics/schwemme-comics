He's not little, he's a great person!

Since Schwemme has a lot of international guests, from all over the world, it was only a matter of time (and me socialising) until more characters had to be added. So from now on, welcome an even more diverse cast! With more names for me to remember! And get wrong hillariously!

*So to explain the comic: It's a pun. 
To explain the new characters: From left to right: Carsten (who is not new, and some people might know as Paul), Adina (who at the time of me writing this finished her studies in germany and went back home), Gaby (who is not only new, but also from Brasil) and Marlowe (who's actual name is Manav, but i got it wrong first and it has been hilarious ever since)
