Sometimes it would be appropriate to format Flo. In this case only figuratively.

Ok, the last few comics were a hassle. Now that the next semester is starting, I'll have to change to a simpler art style.

*Comics in this style would mabye really work. I just don't think you could tell the characters apart, really. Shamelessly stolen Inspired by e9m again.*
