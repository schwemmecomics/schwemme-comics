Franks special shot. Also known as a Frank by Frank. Like his namesake, the drink gives more than 100%.

Recipe: Half-half Gin and Wildberry-Soda, then float in some grenadine sirup

The secret to drinking it, is letting the sirup run after, which gives this it's special taste.

The left overs correspond to Franks efforts to get rid of all the components for his hated Wildberry Lillet in storage.
