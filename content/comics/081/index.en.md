No one thinks about camping inside the Schwemme!

A corn in a cot,
yeah, we like thee!
Because it's club tour,
and we drink for free!

"A corn in a cot" (Original Lyrics by Bernd the Vollkornbrot, translated by Ernestito)

*Bernd and Lenny didn't want to bring their deluxe tent and cots for nothing to Schwemme!*
