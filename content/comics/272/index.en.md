Didn't drink enough target water?

Frank throws beer mats at Arne after the provocation. Due to Frank's throwing skills, which meant he missed everything exciting (Arne, the bar bell, glasses, other guests), Ludo had to adjust the chances of free drinks.

*I think Frank must have hit Arne at some point. With the amount of beer mats that flew, he certainly had his chances.
