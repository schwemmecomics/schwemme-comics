Welcome to the Schwemme, a student club located in the cellar of a student dorm. All the workers are volunteers, most of them study either veterinary medicine or informatics. This is the first comic i made.

Steve sometimes disappears from behind the bar to go for a smoke. Usually he doesn't leave the bar alone, but the idea of a bewildered guest amuses me.

*A lot of decoration in the scene, nothing one should get used to...*
