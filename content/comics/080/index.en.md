Club trip is only twice a year!

The Schwemmlings won't let setbacks like this get them down. The wonderful Clubvorstand decided to have a fun-filled weekend in Leipzig instead!

*As a hommage to the Clubvorstand at that time, who saved our good mood and the weekend. Instead of going to the Saxon Switzerland, we went to the RuTiLUST-Sommerfest on friday at the TV Club (were we were responsible for the main revenue and had a lot of fun in a ball pit), went bowling on saturday and had a very fun opening on sunday. Very merry (and boozy) weekend. Thank you!
