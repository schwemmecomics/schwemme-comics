This might be my favourite comic. It was one of my favourite moments at Schwemme.

Marlowe and I hadn't seen each other for a couple of weeks, and independent of one another decided to cut our hair and beards (he went a bit farther than me). Que him entering Schwemme, us seeing each other and pointing at each other like the spiderman meme. Iconic.

*Marlowe = Manav. Just in case that wasn't clear. Or for some reason you didn't read the previous comics.*
