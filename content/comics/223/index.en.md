They call it Raccoon City
Oh, Raccoon City
Call it Raccoon City limits

The Bluetooth speaker was stolen! By raccoons! Who then used it to throw a raccoon rave! At least, that's the official story.

*And Ernestito is not a morning person. That's why he gets up before everyone else so he can drink his coffee in peace. Just so someone else besides me understands the references: Raccoon City from Resident Evil and Nutbush City Limits by Tina Turner.*
