Enter Lenny and Ernestito. Lenny sometimes uses a cap as a disguise. Then the 'a' stands for 'anderkaver'. Which is a very wrong, very germanised way of writing undercover. Because Lenny has a cap with an A on it.

And do i really have to introduce Ernestito?

The joke: Lenny lost at poker, haha! (Weak, i know. I promise improvement).

*Looking at the first comics i drew feels a bit strange. The characters lack definition, there is a lot of decoration in the scene which has no real reason, the drawing is very basic and both Lennys cap and hefeweizen aren't coloured. Unexpectedly, drawing 200 comics counts as practice.*
