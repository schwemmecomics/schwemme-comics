Sometimes the bartender uses their right to mix what ever the bartender wants to mix themself. Unlucky, if a guest want's to order during that time.

*For the drink which is being mixed, a cocktail shaker, orange juice, vodka and blue curacao are needed. You can identify the ingredients with a little imagination.*
