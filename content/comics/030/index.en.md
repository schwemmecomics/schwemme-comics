Henning is a fun drunk. Especially when Tommy gets worked up. As Hennings long standing friend, Tommy feels responisble for reprimanding him for inappropriate behaviour. 

Henning was hot. so he took of his pullover. Then Pipilotta got cold, so he gave her his shirt. Fortunately, he still wears his pelt.
