It's club trip time again!

Schwemme is going camping again! This time to a lake. The former, current, and future creative minds arrived together a little late. Fortunately, Schwemmlings are never hard to find. They're always where the most fun is to be had.

*Schwenni started the tradition of singing songs and replacing words with “Lurch.” This resulted in some very funny combinations. Lurch meaning in this case the german word for salamanders. Which is more catchy.
