First occurence of Ernest. Ernest is the original, Ernestito his younger self, who travelled to the future for mysterious reasons. Ernest is a fan of the german singer Helene Fischer, so he's drinking out of his special cup, the Helene. 

Therefore: Ernestito = Young Ernest, Hannah Montana = Young Helene Fischer. Logical.
