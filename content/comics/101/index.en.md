The usual is Vodka.

Steve always buys vodka when it's on sale. Always. Much to Franks chagrin.

*I always draw 7-9 comics a page and then split the page into strips. During the process the resolution increases. With this comic I noticed strange things happening with the colour layer, maybe because of the brush i use ... i'll have to observe this.
