Another kind of stockpiling.

Hamsters carry food in their cheeks around, so i thought, if cheese, what other supplys could Flo carry with him? The answer was obvious.

*This is also based on the pocket cheese story. The steak was drawn raw, to be easier to draw and to be easily recognised. Of course, Flo would always deep fry his steak for preservation.
