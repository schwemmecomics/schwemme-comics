Escotilla de Fornica.

In storage at Schwemme, there's a hatch, for getting up on the coffering. In a moment of inappropriation, this was named fucking hatch, or because spanish is a more charming language, Escotilla de Fornica. This creates wonderful set-ups for situational comedy. And of course, Ernest always notices when something fun is happening.

*Nice little turn of perspective between second and third panel. Sometimes it's the little tricks which make a comic strip special for me.
