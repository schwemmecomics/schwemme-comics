It was a long way home.

Ali and me were talking the whole night with Vollmer about various stuff, while drinking various stuff. We continued the conversation while walking with him to his bike, expecting a walk to the physics faculty (not far). Instead, we walked to the Thomas Church (very far) and then almost back to Schwemme.

*Had to look up different towers to put into the background for the funnies, and settled on the Eiffel Tower, the Slanted Tower of Pisa, and the MDR Tower (the only one we actually walked past)
