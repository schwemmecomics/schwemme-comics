A man of few words.

At the 4th of May I started a ridiculous challenge, by keeping a tally for shots of Peppermint (Rebellion) and Cherry (Empire). A few people ordered Woodruff, which we counted as the Waldilorians. Empire won after someone bought a whole bottle. 

*Ernest Fett you can probably identify. The bartender is Manni, based on the character Obi-Wan meets in a cantina in Attack of the Clones, Dexter Jettster.*
