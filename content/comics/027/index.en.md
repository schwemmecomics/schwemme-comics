A typical bar round and Tommy orderes Andalö, of course. Tommy is the one who brought Schwemme their signature liquer: Andalö, which is made from sea buckthorn. He once brought a bottle from northern germany and Andalö has been part of Schwemme inventory ever since.

Might be if you drink enough of it, you get diarrhea. So he's not wrong.

*Note the arrows relating to the statistics of the amount of each shot ordered.*
