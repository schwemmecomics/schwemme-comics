Stone. Vielleicht kann ich ja mit aufwändigeren Panels von meinen unkreativen Witzen ablenken._

TITEL_EN: Friedens Park
TEXT_EN:
I'm goin' down to Schwemme gonna have myself a time,  
"Friendly faces everwhere humble folks without temptation" 
I'm goin' down to Schwemme gonna leave my woes behind,  
Ample Drinking Day or Night, people spouting, "Howdy, Neighbor"  
I'm headin' down to Schwemme gonna see if I can't unwind,  
I like girls with big fat titties, I like girls with deep vaginas!  
So come on down to Schwemme, and meet some friends of mine.

New art style! I think I'll keep it. One should build up on success.

*I thought of adorning myself with the feathers of someone else. In this case the feathers of Parker and Stone. Maybe I more elaborate panels will distract from my uncreative jokes.
