Not everything made from glass has a deposit on it.

The day had to come, on which Ernestito had to pay for his audacity. May he rest in piece. At least his sacrifice serves as a warning for others, so they may learn from his mistakes.

*Wild comic to draw, three different backgrounds and perspectives, a lot of colour, text placement ... I'm not sure it works without the previous one. But does it have to?*
