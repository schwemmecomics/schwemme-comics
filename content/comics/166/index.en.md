Or Es-Cater-lation? Things that the bar staff couldn't laugh about so much that day.

Opinions about the catering event differ somewhat. For some, it was a relaxed club evening with everyone making sandwiches together. For others, it was very hot, very cramped, and very stressful.

*I had actually (almost) finished the catering comics earlier. Unfortunately, I accidentally deleted the page and had to redraw everything. The biggest loss was in the second panel here, which I had actually designed to be much more elaborate, with the bar staff in the front row and a view of the crowd. It's a shame, but the simplicity also gets the joke across.*
