Heya,

Surprise! New Website!
I created the old website via Google Sites and with every comic i uploaded, it got harder to handle. So i decided to create a new one. I haven't written code for more than 5 years, so don't expect a masterpiece of information technology. 
Die Seite macht was sie machen soll, alles was sie braucht ist Leute die sie nutzen.

I took the liberty of creating a bit of additional functionality, everything is cleaner now. The page itself should be better translated and run smoother. The linkage should also be fixed on this. I added a share button eingebaut and a news page, where i will post announcements like this one.

Also below every comic and announcement you should find a comment section, for you to complain about the lack of new comics. On the topic of new comics: Whatever it is i need to draw new ones, i don't seem to have it at the moment. I'll keep refining this website and am in the process of translating the comics (as of now i translated the first 100), so you'll be able to read them on the english page without pesky translators notes.

I ask for your continued patience. 

As always: thank you for reading and pleas share the joy!
