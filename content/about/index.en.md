# Welcome to Tales From The Schwemme!
A collection of sequential art, which tries to commemorate anecdotes and peculiarities from the **Schwemme** and the people there.
This is a steam of conciousnes, which comprises events, quotes, other media, jokes and situational comedy from the authors point of view. 

> These are the *adventures of the Schwemmlings*. Their mission: To explore strange new drinks; to seek out new flavours and combinations; to boldly mix what noone has mixed before!

Also good to know: 
* I am just one person drawing the comics, when i should actually do other stuff. Updates will happen irregularily and only as long as i enjoy it.
* All the characters and events are fictional, parallels to real persons and events are purely coincidental and should be treated as such. It is firstly and foremost satirical, so behaviour and statements are the opposite of representative. 
* We all love each other. Especially Olaf.
* I like to take **constructive** criticism. Anyone who does not like my works can stop looking at them anytime. 
* This is a way of controlled publishing the comics. If it works, there could be more happening. Who knows, maybe my comics will one day end up on someones bookshelf.
